# Readingapp
<p>This is another app in my ongoing attempt to learrn django and to provide examples for students. This app tracks the books I am reading, when I start and when I finsih them. It also allows me to post notes on the books as I read them. My own private version of goodreads, if you will.</p>
<p><strong>First Commit</strong> This commit has the settings, and models complete. It also has several views and templates to show them. It does not yet have any forms.</p>
