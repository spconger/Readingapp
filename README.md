# Readingapp
<p>This is another app in my ongoing attempt to learrn django and to provide examples for students. This app tracks the books I am reading, when I start and when I finsih them. It also allows me to post notes on the books as I read them. My own private version of goodreads, if you will.</p>
<p><strong>First Commit</strong> This commit has the settings, and models complete. It also has several views and templates to show them. It does not yet have any forms.</p>
<p><strong>Second commit</strong> This commit adds to views, including a view that gives the list of books for a particular author. It also includes most of the forms to add materials to the database. What is still lacking is a form to update the readings which allows the user to enter the finish date.</p>
